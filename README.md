# Syncplay
Syncplay is an android app that allows friends to watch videos or movies together in real-time. With Syncplay, everyone can synchronize the video playback without worrying about connecting over a video call and one person having to stream the entire movie. This improves the overall viewing experience for everyone.

## Features
- Create a room and invite friends to join
- Synchronized video playback with friends in real-time
- Pure Kotlin in the frontend with a Ktor backend
- Uses websockets to connect clients

## Getting started

2. Create a room and invite your friends
3. Choose a video or movie to watch together
4. Press the play button and enjoy the synchronized playback
