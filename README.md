## About
Syncplay is an android app that allows friends to watch videos or movies together in real-time. With Syncplay, everyone can synchronize the video playback without worrying about connecting over a video call and one person having to stream the entire movie. This improves the overall viewing experience for everyone.

### Disclaimer
Note that this app was created under time constraints as I was preparing for my college exams. As a result, there may be some bugs or areas for improvement. However, I have made an effort to maintain a clean and organized codebase using the MVVM architecture pattern. I appreciate any contributions or feedback to help improve this project.

## Features
- Create a room and invite friends to join
- Synchronized video playback with friends in real-time
- Pure Kotlin in the frontend with a Ktor backend
- Uses websockets to connect clients
- MVVM architecture (I made this app in a hurry, so the code is not very clean)

## Getting started
1. Download the app from the [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.flyprosper.syncplay)
2. Create a room and invite your friends
3. Choose a video or movie to watch together
4. Press the play button and enjoy the synchronized playback
